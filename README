Algorithm-URL-Shorten

Algorithm::URL::Shorten generates short codes used to map and represent
longer URLs.

The codes generated with Algorithm::URL::Shorten are unique for every URL,
so that every time it is used on the same URL, it will generate the same
codes.

The short strings are alphanumeric ASCII ([a-z], [A-Z], and [0-9]) for a
total of 62 characters, which may be mapped in, depending on the lenght,
62 ^ n codes (where n is the actual size of the strings generated).
